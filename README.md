# README
These are my homework files for my Directed Study: Stochastic Calculus.

The way these are run is that the .rmd and .bib files are opened and edited in RStudio and then compiled into LaTeX via the .pdf file option in knitr. 

This is for personal use only and no pull requests will be considered.
